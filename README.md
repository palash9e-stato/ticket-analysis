This workflow is an AI powered Complaint Ticket Handling Agent built using n8n.
It automatically reads incoming emails, classifies whether they are complaints, extracts customer details, sentiment, urgency, and product information using LLMs.
High urgency complaints trigger an AI generated personalized reply and are logged into a separate Airtable table.
Non complaint or low priority messages are stored separately for internal review.
The workflow fully automates customer support operations, reduces response time, and ensures consistent, high-quality communication.
